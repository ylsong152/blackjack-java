GAMEPLAN:

Make a working deck first, then
Implement the BlackJack game, then
Implement the client and server, allowing client to play BlackJack through sending commands, then
Implement the AI for the BlackJack game.

Files for this:
Card.java (object of a card)
Deck.java (object of a deck, includes suits, rank, value AND shuffling & drawing etc)
BlackJack.java (logic for the game of blackjack, how card is valued, how to deal the card, how to compare the value) **Deal with Ace logic
BlackJackServer.java (instance of a server, only handle IO from client, no logic here)
BlackJackClient.java (instance of a client, only send out a set of commands and receive certain outputs)
DealerAI.java (contains the logic for dealer AI, decisions for drawing more card or not)

Potential logic for DealerAI:

Way 1:
IF client has 2 cards:
    IF value <= 15 - must draw a card,
    ELSE IF value <= 16 - 50% chance to draw a card,
    ELSE IF value <= 17 - 30% chance to draw a card,
    ELSE IF value <= 18 - 10% chance to draw a card,

IF client has 3 cards:
    IF value <= 15 - must draw a card,
    ELSE IF value <= 16 - 40% chance to draw a card,
    ELSE IF value <= 17 - 30% chance to draw a card,
    ELSE IF value <= 18 - 10% chance to draw a card,

IF client has 4 cards:
    IF value <= 15 - must draw a card,
    ELSE IF value <= 16 - 20% chance to draw a card,
    ELSE IF value <= 17 - 10% chance to draw a card,

Way 2:
Dealer will just draw until 17 lol
